## Hey, this is us ðŸ‘‹

We're Pleisto, a technology company with a vision to "augment human intellect" ðŸ§  and foster a better world.

We're thrilled to introduce two game-changing projects: **Flappy Engine** and **Flappy**. These innovative, open-source tools are designed to supercharge the industrial application of AI by harnessing the power of Large Language Models, such as GPT.

**Flappy**, our Production-Ready LLM Agent SDK for Every Developer, is designed to bridge the gap between large language models and developers. It allows you to harness the power of AI, no matter your technical expertise or project complexity. 

Building on the foundation of Flappy, our **Flappy Engine** takes things a step further. It's a comprehensive AI Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that not only connects applications with underlying AI models, but also intelligently automates tasks based on model outputs. By integrating with various data sources, it can increase the speed and efficiency of your AI workflows. Furthermore, Flappy Engine employs smart caching and other acceleration techniques to ensure maximum performance.

In the past, we embarked on an ambitious project called MashPod, formerly known as Brickdoc, an all-in-one workspace for remote teams. As we've evolved, our focus has shifted to the Yuren Engine. We're leveraging the insights gained from previous projects, along with our extensive experience in Semantic Web and knowledge graphs, to drive these new initiatives.

Stay tuned for updates ðŸ“¢ as we continue to innovate and move forward ðŸš€. We're the 'developer behind developers', driven by the same spirit of invention and exploration that fuels your work. We look forward to empowering tech professionals around the globe with our next-gen AI BaaS.
