## Hey, this is us ðŸ‘‹

At Pleisto, we believe in the power of technology to "augment human intellect" ðŸ§  and make the world a better place. 

That's why we've created **MashPod**, an open-source all-in-one workspace that's like an operating system for your work. 
MashPod is a digital headquarters designed to help remote teams around the world bring their workflows together, 
unify their docs, data, and systems, and drive their business forward ðŸš€.

And with the help of the Semantic Web(Yes, we were partly inspired by Tim Berners-Lee's [Solid](https://solidproject.org/))  and the LLM, 
MashPod can also be used to create in-house knowledge graphs and as a low-code platform for citizen developers. 

MashPod is **coming soon** ðŸ“…, so stay tuned for updates ðŸ“¢. 

We're a team within your team, driven by the same spirit of invention and exploration that drives you.
