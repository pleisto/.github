## Hey, this is us ðŸ‘‹

We're Pleisto, a technology company with a vision to "augment human intellect" ðŸ§  and foster a better world.

We're excited to introduce **Yuren Engine**, our innovative, open-source AI Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). Yuren Engine is designed to harness the power of Large Language Models, such as GPT, to accelerate the industrial application of AI.

Yuren Engine serves as a bridge between underlying AI models and specific applications, enabling developers to leverage complex AI capabilities without needing deep technical expertise. It integrates with various data sources, intelligently automates tasks based on model outputs, and provides enhanced efficiency through smart caching and other acceleration techniques.

Previously, we embarked on an ambitious project, initially known as Brickdoc and later renamed to MashPod. This was an effort to create an all-in-one workspace for remote teams. As we've evolved, our focus has shifted to the Yuren Engine. We're leveraging the insights gained from previous projects, along with our extensive experience in Semantic Web and knowledge graphs, to drive this new initiative.

Stay tuned for updates ðŸ“¢ as we continue to innovate and move forward ðŸš€. We're the 'developer behind developers', driven by the same spirit of invention and exploration that fuels your work. We look forward to empowering tech professionals around the globe with our next-gen AI BaaS.
